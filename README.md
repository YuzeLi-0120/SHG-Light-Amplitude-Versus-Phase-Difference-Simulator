# SHG-Light-Amplitude-Versus-Phase-Difference-Simulator
A little program aiming at simulating the behavior of the SHG light stimulated from crystals.

The program I wrote outputs the schemes of SHG light amplitude versus phase difference.
Below is the first scheme under different method of phase matching. 
The black dashed line represents the theoretically perfect phase matching condition.
The orange line represents the theoretically condition while using QPM method.
The yellow line represents the theoretically condition while using APP (our intention) method.
The purple line represents the theoretically completely mismatched condition.
